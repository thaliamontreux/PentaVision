# Pentastar-web Programming Rules

1. Always show error messages in a bubble on the bottom right with a green background and black text.
2. You are free to create database entries.
3. The program when started should automatically run the SQL script to make sure all tables and fields are correct.
4. Always use the same design as the JPEG image in `docs\\ui-references\\storage-modules-manager-reference.png`.
5. You are free to create any file you need or edit any file; if you can’t open a file, try again several times.
6. Always make every form with elegance in mind. Polish the UI as we program.
