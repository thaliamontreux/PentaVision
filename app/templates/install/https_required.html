    <h1>HTTPS required for installer</h1>
    <p>The installer can only be accessed over HTTPS.</p>
    <p>
      If you are behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, ensure it terminates
      TLS and forwards HTTPS requests to this application.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #6b7280; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      For example, with an HTTP reverse proxy you should set the
      <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> header to <code>https</code> when the
      client connection is secure, so the installer can detect that the
      request is arriving over HTTPS.
