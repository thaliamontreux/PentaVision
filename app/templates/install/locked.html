    <h1>Installer Locked</h1>
    <p>
      The installation wizard has already completed and is now locked. To adjust
      configuration, edit your <code>.env</code> file or use administrative tools
      within the application.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #6b7280; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
      The lock state is controlled by the <code>INSTALL_LOCKED</code> setting in
      your environment or <code>.env</code> file. Unlocking and re-running the
      installer on a production system should be done with care.
